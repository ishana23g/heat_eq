# Heat Equation Simulation Project

The main showcase of this project is cuda and openGL interop. Where we can leverage high performance from cuda and get real time rendering via cuda. 

# How to compile and run

Use the provided make file. All you need to do is run `make`. 
For running the program it will just be `./cuda_heat_equation`.
There are some interactive functionalities:
* 1: Switch to 1D simulation.
* 2: Switch to 2D simulation.
* B: Toggle boundary conditions between Dirichlet and Neumann.
* R: Reset the simulation.
* Mouse Left Button: Click and drag to add heat.


# Ways to improve performace

* Using pre defined constants with the `#define` instead of setting `const int` etc
